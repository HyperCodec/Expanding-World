# Expanding World

### Setup
Do /setexpandcenter at wherever you want to have it happen. Then, do /setexpandsize to set the starting size. When you are ready, do /startexpand. The world will then expand every day (whenever the time is 1).

### Config
- increaseby - How much the border increases each time.
- started - This is just used by commands and such and is automatically managed (just ignore it)

To have config changes take effect, restart the server or do /reload confirm
